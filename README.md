# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This project implements a spam email classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of models to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. Visualizations are also provided for common spam words using Seaborn.</p>

<h1>Features:</h1>
<p>Data preprocessing with cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
Feature extraction using TF-IDF.
Machine learning models for classification.
Visualizations of most frequent spam words using Seaborn.</p>

<h1>How To Execute</h1>

<p> Run the Streamlit App: Launch the web application using the following command:</p>
