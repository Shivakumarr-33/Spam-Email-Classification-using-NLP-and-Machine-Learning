# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This project implements a spam email classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of models to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. Visualizations are also provided for common spam words using Seaborn.</p>

<h1>Features:</h1>
<p>Data preprocessing with cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
Feature extraction using TF-IDF.
Machine learning models for classification.
Visualizations of most frequent spam words using Seaborn.</p>

<h1>Key Features</h1>
<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Cleaning and tokenization of email text.
Conversion of text into a structured format for analysis.</p>
<h2>Feature Extraction</h2>
<p>Implementation of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for representing textual data as numerical features.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
<p>Training and evaluation of models to classify emails.
Comparison of model performances for optimal results.</p>
<h2>Visualization</h2>
<p>Seaborn bar plots showcase the most frequent spam words with vibrant color palettes.</p>


<h1>How To Execute</h1>

<p> Run the Streamlit App: Launch the web application using the following command:</p>
